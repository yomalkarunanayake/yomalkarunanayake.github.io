                    For my final year project for university I decided to try a different path and do a project that was somewhat uncommon among the projects done by most students. It has always been an interest of mine to explore new and simple ways to do everyday things, which might be the reason for my interest in the UI/ UX field. For this specific project I wanted to go even further and try to do a project with a VUI (Voice User Interface), and the first idea that came to my mind was to make a voice commanded mobile application for the visually impaired. But, since the time and resources as a student is limited, specially for an individual project, the area of the project was narrowed down to the APIIT City Campus building. <br/>The aim of this project was to develop a method that would aid the accessibility of visual impaired individuals in a foreign indoor environment. In order to do so a mobile application was developed which can be used by the visually impaired to aid their navigation within APIIT City Campus building.

                    Designing and implementing an application from scratch by oneself is a challenging task. It can be even more challenging if the task is about rarely discussed territories such as indoor navigation for the visually impaired. Even though this is not uncharted territory mobile application wise, the number of solutions are very limited and complex. This meant not only re-imagining a whole new process, but also making it simplified enough so it could be implemented within a limited period of time and resources.

                    A combination of Literal and Collective study was done for the research data gathering. The Literal study was a selection of literary reviews on the project topic, as well as a review of other topic related printed and online media. The Community (Population) study was a group of randomly selected visually impaired individuals who live in Colombo and Gampaha Districts.

                    Since the visual design for the user interface was minimum, I skipped the Lo-Fi wireframing and moved onto a High-Fi prototype. Each of the functions have separate colours that could be identified from one another, and every function has a symbol which would indicate the current function in use. These colours and symbols have been implemented using contrasting colours, which makes for easy identification by the partially blind user. Furthermore, each activity will show the current function name on top, as well as showing the steps in navigation function in large white text on a black background, contrasting the text for better readability for the partially blind.

                    APIIT Navigation was chosen as an appropriate name considering the application specifically being made to be used by visually impaired users inside APIIT City Campus for navigational purposes. The logo was made by combining the silhouette of a visually impaired person with Braille letters 'A' and 'N' on either side of the silhouette as an acronym for APIIT Navigation. The goal was to make it as simplistic as possible while representing a general idea about the application.

                    A selection of User Stories were put into one iteration considering how related and important they are to each other as functions. Then the development was done based on the Iteration Plans which describes the tasks or functions that are scheduled into each iteration. Then at the end of each iteration Functional Tests were done to find out if the iteration was a success, which was helpful to gradually complete each task in a controlled and coordinated manner while lowering the number of failure and errors in each function, and then an application as a whole.

                        Working on this project made me realize how important it is to research and actually get feedback from who the product is made for rather than making assumptions by myself as a user. As someone who is not severley visually impaired it took empathy, curiosity, making mistaked and learning from them as well as numerous tests to come to this final solution. Even though it might have been frustrating at times when something goes the complete opposite way you had planned, doing this project was a humbling and a grateful opportunity for me to discover everything that went into making a product and made me even more interested in the role of a UI UX designer.
