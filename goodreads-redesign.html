                    Goodreads is a social cataloguing platform where book enthusiasts can search and catalogue their books, and connect with others in the book reading community. Even though I have heard about goodreads, I didn't really look into it until recently when I started reading some of my unfinished books that I have been neglecting for a while that were gathering dust in my bookshelf. I thought keeping track and reading the thoughts and ideas from other readers on the books would motivate me to keep reading them and develop more interest, which it certainly did. But from the get go I realized that even though goodreads is providing an amazing platform for book readers, most of its functionality is hindered by the confusing navigation and the outdated look and feel on both their website and their mobile application. <br/>The aim of the project was to re-design the goodreads website and mobile application to make a cohesive platform, with a new effective and efficient user first User Interface while maintaining their current brand identity.

                    The primary goal was to declutter the User Interface towards a minimalistic look while still delivering necessary information and content to the user. For instance in the home page I kept a similar layout for the website while introducing new elements to seperate different types of content allowing the user to easily recognize one type of information content from one other. For the mobile design I used similar elements from the desktop version to maintain a corresponding theme between the platforms.
