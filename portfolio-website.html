                    While researching about the UI UX field one of the first things I came to learn was the importance of having a personal website and how it was also considered as an essential part of a job candidate by many recruiters in the field. My aim with creating this website was to showcase sample UI UX projects to the recruiter so they can get an insight on my skills and work process as well as a bit about who I am. Overall the main objective was to create a website worthy of the recruiters time while delivering the content in a simple yet effective way.

                    I decided to have a single page design to deliver the landing and the basic information such as brief introduction about myself, education, and contact information. I made use of white spaces inbetween defferent content on the page to give a more simplistic and clean look aswell as to help the user easily identify each different type of content from one another. For the case studies I decided to use a thumbnail gallery in the same page that would direct the user to each case study in a seperate page. To navigate to different content in the page I used a fixed navigation menu at the bottom of the screen. The reason behind choosing a single page layout was to make the content easily accessible and skimmable to the visitors of the website without taking too much of their time. For the case studies I made their own fixed navigation menu, each page having a link to the previous project, next project, and a link back to Home page. <br/>

                    The main goal while designing elements for the website was to make the best possible expierience for the visitor, in this case recruiters and hiring managers. Since the target visitor is likely visiting the website during busy work hours, my aim was to provide efficient structural and navigational elements which made the time they spend on this website worthwhile. This was acheived by several different design elements ranging from the single page design, fixed menu for easy navigation, white spaces to easily identify different sections, as well as using larger fonts to highlight important sections and smaller fonts for detailed paragraphs to make the content easy to digest and skimmable. <br/>

                    This being my personal website I thought of using custom illustrations drawn by me to be used as banner images and thumbnails for case studies as a way of adding some of my own personality into it. Since I've had a passion for art ever since I could remember this was a fun side project for me to work on as well.

                    After coding the pages it was now time to add the final touches such as checking responsiveness and optimizing for mobile, adding favicons, testing in different browsers, making sure pages have context and are linked properly, checking meta data and cleaning up html, checking spelling erros, etc, etc and then finally launching the site. For hosting the website I chose github pages which allows free hosting through github repository.

                    The thought of creating a web portfolio was a bit of an overwhelming thought at first, specially because there are so many impressive and well designed portfolios all over the web. But once I started the process it just became more and more interesting and exciting to work on. Even though it might not be the most amazingly designed portfolio on the internet, I think I successfully achieved what I wanted when I visualized what my web portfolio to look like, which is simplistic and efficient. Moving forward I plan to consider this as an ongoing project and make better improvements as I sharpen my skills and gain better experience.
